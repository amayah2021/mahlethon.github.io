        <b>CS105: Problem Solving with Computational Thinking</b><br>
        This course focuses on teaching students the higher-order (critical) thinking skills needed in computer science (analysis, evaluation, logic, and reasoning). The course starts by explaining how computers work and then focuses on having students read and write flow charts as an easy way to introduce programming concepts such as variable, selection, repetition, and arrays without having to worry too much about syntax. This course is designed for individuals who do not have any computing background.
